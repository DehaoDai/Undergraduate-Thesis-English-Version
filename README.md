The title of undergraduate thesis (English Verison) is Law of Large Numbers for the Linear Self-interacting Diffusion Driven by α-Stable Motion.

ADescription: In this research, the specific asymptotic behavior of the linear self-interacting diffusion was discussed and extended to θ > 0 and θ < 0 with two rates of convergences.

• Awarded Excellent Graduate Capstone (Thesis) in 2020 Donghua University (Top 3%)

• Extended the linear self-interacting diffusion driven by Brownian motion, and considered the linear self-interacting diffusion by α-stable motion based on a stochastic differential model for the shape of a growing polymer

• Introduced law of large numbers associated with the process with 1 < α < 2 and θ > 0 based on the result provide by Xichao Sun and Litan Yan, and obtained the results under different convergence speeds

• Constructed the almost surely and L^p convergence under the situation θ < 0 and extended the studied stochastic processes from X. Sun and L. Yan
